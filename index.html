      <h1>Teacher's Motivating Style and Academic Outcomes</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      This website is intended as a resource for teachers and informal educators.
      The first part serves as a summary of literature on Self Determination Theory as it relates to Autonomy Support as well as literature on Motivation, Engagement, and Academic Competence in Students.
      The second part provides summaries of ten studies, as well as links to the studies themselves.
    </p>
    <h2>Controlling vs Noncontrolling vs Undirected</h2>
    <p>
      Imposing extrinsic rewards on tasks of a creative nature have been shown to have a negative effect on creativity and intrinsic motivation.
      In other words, controlled learning is associated with extrinsic motivation, while noncontrolled learning is associated with intrinsic motivation.
      Additionally, in nondirected learning situations, in which there is no specific directions to learn, learning occurs as a function of interest and engagement, and is associated with intrinsic motivation. (Grolnick & Ryan, 1987)
    </p>
    <h2>Self Determination Theory</h2>
    <p>
      Self Determination Theory posits that people have three essential needs that must be met for optimal satisfaction and learning: autonomy (one's actions must be self-endorsed and motivated), competence (one must feel that the challenges they face are optimal for their level of development), and relatedness (one must feel that they have secure relationships with others). (Shen, McCaughtry, Martin, & Fahlman, 2009).
    </p>
    <h3>Autonomy Support</h3>
    <p>
      Teachers' instructional styles can be described on a continuum ranging from autonomy supportive to controlling. Autonomy supportive teachers foster students' intrinsic motivation, and connect it to classroom activities. Additionally, autonomy supportive teachers use language that is noncontrolling and supports student choice making. The language they use is informational and centered around competence. Teachers also provide rationales for learning tasks, rather than relying on external rewards. Instruction is based around student interests and choices, and takes into account their needs as learners. Finally, autonomy supportive teachers acknowledge student feelings, even when said feelings are negative. To contrast, controlling teachers impose strict rules, rely on external regulations such as incentives and consequences as opposed to rationales for tasks, and use language that is evaluative rather than informative. (Jang, Reeve, & Deci, 2010). Additionally, controlling teachers often bypass students' intrinsic motivation by offering extrinsic motivators to shape adherence to their agendas (Jang et al., 210).
	Autonomy is distinct from independence and individuality. Independence relates to not relying on others, and individuality relates to valuing the individual over the collective. One can have autonomy (choice, and the sense that decisions stem from the self) and still rely on others. SImilarly, one can value and act in the collective for autonomous reasons (Chirkov & Ryan, 2001).
    </p>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Teachers' instructional style can also be categorized along a continuum ranging from structured to chaotic. Teachers who provide structure give guides on how educational outcomes can be achieved, as well as what expectations exist for the task. Provision of structure has been associated with feelings of competence and mastery motivation, as well as a sense of control in learning situations. Additionally, provision of structure is associated with increases self regulation. When teachers provide clear instructions, guidance during learning tasks, and give clear constructive feedback, they support students in developing a sense of what it takes to do well in school. It is important to note that while the two are often confused and/or conflated, structure and control are not the same thing, and structure can be provided in either an autonomy supportive or controlling way (Jang et al., 2010).
    </p>
    <h2>Engagement</h2>
    <p>
      Engagement has to do with students' involvement — both emotional and behavioral — in learning situations. Engagement can be measured through a person's effort and positive emotion, as well as through the attempts they make to influence a learning environment. (Reeve, Jang, Carrell, Jeon, & Barch, 2004). It acts as a path through which motivation acts on learning and development. Additionally, engagement is used by teachers as a measure of motivation, and has been shown to predict dropout (Reeve et al., 2004). Engagement is influenced by the sociocultural contexts in which learning occurs, including teachers' instructional style. (Jang et al., 2010).
    </p>
    <h2>Theories of Motivation: Intrinsic vs Extrinsic</h2>
    <p>
      Motivation is often described on a continuum from entirely intrinsic to entirely extrinsic. One such scale describes motivation as ranging from autonomous ("I'm studying because it's personally important to me") to controlled ("I'm studying because I would feel guilty if I wouldn't do so) (Vansteenkiste et al., 2012). Other scales of motivation, such as that on the Rochester Assessment Package for Schools — Student Self Report, define four types of motivation: intrinsic self-motivation ("I do my homework because I find it interesting or fun."), identified self-regulation ("I do my homework because I want to understand and learn new things"), introjected self-regulation ("I do my homework because I would feel guilty or ashamed if I did not"), and external self-regulation ("I do my homework because the teacher would get mad or I would get in trouble if I did not") (Tucker et al., 2002).
	Intrinsic motivation can be bolstered by a number of aspects of a learning situation. Connecting learning tasks to objects and characters that are of prior interest to individuals is one such way to bolster intrinsic motivation. Additionally, when individuals are given choices in a task or activity, they are more intrinsically motivated to complete the task. The benefits of choice (higher enjoyment, better performance, and better persistence) appear even when the choices are not of central importance to the task (Cordova & Lepper, 1996).

    <h2>Connell's Model of Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Connell outlined a model of motivation in which engagement is the main factor in academic achievement. In this model, teacher instructional styles (structure, autonomy support, interest in the student) affect student self-systems, such as motivation and perceived competence, which in turn affect engagement. Finally, engagement acts directly on academic achievement (as cited in Tucker et al., 2002).
    </p>
    <h2>Mastery vs Performance Climates</h2>
    <p>
      In a mastery climate, students perceive that personal growth in learning and skills is valued. In a performance climate, students perceive that superior performance is rewarded. Mastery climates give students the chance to feel competent and autonomous, whereas performance climates do not provide such opportunities, and thus cause students to feel less self-determined (Cox & Williams, 2008).
    </p>
    <h2>Cognitive Evolution Theory</h2>
    <p>
      Cognitive Evolution Theory is similar to Self Determination Theory in that it posits that people develop motivational styles based on perceptions of their own competence. As in Self Determination Theory, contexts that support autonomy bolster people's perceptions of competence, leading to more intrinsic motivation, whereas controlling contexts thwart perceptions of competence, leading to more extrinsic motivation (Guay, Boggiano, & Vallerand, 2001).
    </p>
    <h2>Diathesis-Stress Model of Motivaiton</h2>
    <p>
      The diathesis-stress model of achievement processes posits motivational style as a more stable trait. Two models emerge.  In the first model, motivational style mediates the relationship between teacher autonomy support and perceived competence — teacher autonomy support affects motivation, which affects perceptions of competence. In the second model, motivational style moderates the relationship between autonomy support and competence — controlling styles are related with lower levels of perceived competence, but only among students with extrinsic motivational styles (Guay et al., 2001).
