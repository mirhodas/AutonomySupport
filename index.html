      <h1>Teacher's Motivating Style and Academic Outcomes</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      This websitet is intended as a resource for teachers and informal educators. <br>
      The first part serves as a summary of literature on Self Determination Theory as it relates to Autonomy Support as well as literature on Motivation, Engagement, and Academic Competence in Students. <br>
      The second part provides summaries of eleven studies, as well as links to the studies themselves.

    <h2>Controlling vs Noncontrolling vs Undirected</h2>
    <p>
      Imposing extrinsic rewards on tasks of a creative nature have been shown to have a negative effect on creativity and intrinsic motivation. <br>
      In other words, controlled learning is associated with extrinsic motivation, while noncontrolled learning is associated with intrinsic motivation. <br>
      Additionally, in nondirected learning situations, in which there is no specific directions to learn, learning occurs as a function of interest and engagement, and is associated with intrinsic motivation.

    <h2>Self Determination Theory</h2>
    <h3>Autonomy Support</h3>
    <p>
      Teachers' instructional styles can be described on a continuum ranging from autonomy supportive to controlling. <br>
      Autonomy supportive teachers foster students' intrinsic motivation, and connect it to classroom activities. <br>
      Additionally, autonomy supportive teachers use language that is noncontrolling and supports student choice making. <br>
      The language they use is informational and centered around competence. <br>
      Teachers also provide rationales for learning tasks, rather than relying on external rewards. <br>
      Instruction is based around student interests and choices, and takes into account their needs as learners. <br>
      Finally, autonomy supportive teachers acknowledge student feelings, even when said feelings are negative. <br>
      To contrast, controlling teachers impose strict rules, rely on external regulations such as incentives and consequences as opposed to rationales for tasks, and use language that is evaluative rather than informative. (Jang, Reeve, Deci). <br>
      Additionally, controlling teachers often bypass students' intrinsic motivation by offering extrinsic motivators to shape adherence to their agendas (Reeve, Jang, Carrell, Jeon, Barch).
    </p>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Teachers' instructional style can also be categorized along a continuum ranging from structured to chaotic. <br>
      Teachers who provide structure give guides on how educational outcomes can be achieved, as well as what expectations exist for the task. <br>
      Provision of structure has been associated with feelings of competence and mastery motivation, as well as a sense of control in learning situations. <br>
      Additionally, provision of structure is associated with increases self regulation. When teachers provide clear instructions, guidance during learning tasks, and give clear constructive feedback, they support students in developing a sense of what it takes to do well in school. <br>
      It is important to note that while the two are often confused and/or conflated, structure and control are not the same thing, and structure can be provided in either an autonomy supportive or controlling way. (Jang, Reeve, Deci)
