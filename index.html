      <h1>Teacher's Motivating Style and Academic Outcomes</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      This website is intended as a resource for teachers and informal educators.
      The first part serves as a summary of literature on Self Determination Theory as it relates to Autonomy Support as well as literature on Motivation, Engagement, and Academic Competence in Students.
      The second part provides summaries of ten studies, as well as links to the studies themselves.
    </p>
    <h2>Controlling vs Noncontrolling vs Undirected</h2>
    <p>
      Imposing extrinsic rewards on tasks of a creative nature have been shown to have a negative effect on creativity and intrinsic motivation.
      In other words, controlled learning is associated with extrinsic motivation, while noncontrolled learning is associated with intrinsic motivation.
      Additionally, in nondirected learning situations, in which there is no specific directions to learn, learning occurs as a function of interest and engagement, and is associated with intrinsic motivation. (Grolnick & Ryan, 1987)
    </p>
    <h2>Self Determination Theory</h2>
    <p>
      Self Determination Theory posits that people have three essential needs that must be met for optimal satisfaction and learning: autonomy (one's actions must be self-endorsed and motivated), competence (one must feel that the challenges they face are optimal for their level of development), and relatedness (one must feel that they have secure relationships with others). (Shen, McCaughtry, Martin, & Fahlman, 2009).
    </p>
    <h3>Autonomy Support</h3>
    <p>
      Teachers' instructional styles can be described on a continuum ranging from autonomy supportive to controlling. Autonomy supportive teachers foster students' intrinsic motivation, and connect it to classroom activities. Additionally, autonomy supportive teachers use language that is noncontrolling and supports student choice making. The language they use is informational and centered around competence. Teachers also provide rationales for learning tasks, rather than relying on external rewards. Instruction is based around student interests and choices, and takes into account their needs as learners. Finally, autonomy supportive teachers acknowledge student feelings, even when said feelings are negative. To contrast, controlling teachers impose strict rules, rely on external regulations such as incentives and consequences as opposed to rationales for tasks, and use language that is evaluative rather than informative. (Jang, Reeve, & Deci, 2010). Additionally, controlling teachers often bypass students' intrinsic motivation by offering extrinsic motivators to shape adherence to their agendas (Jang et al., 210).
	Autonomy is distinct from independence and individuality. Independence relates to not relying on others, and individuality relates to valuing the individual over the collective. One can have autonomy (choice, and the sense that decisions stem from the self) and still rely on others. SImilarly, one can value and act in the collective for autonomous reasons (Chirkov & Ryan, 2001).
    </p>
    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Teachers' instructional style can also be categorized along a continuum ranging from structured to chaotic. Teachers who provide structure give guides on how educational outcomes can be achieved, as well as what expectations exist for the task. Provision of structure has been associated with feelings of competence and mastery motivation, as well as a sense of control in learning situations. Additionally, provision of structure is associated with increases self regulation. When teachers provide clear instructions, guidance during learning tasks, and give clear constructive feedback, they support students in developing a sense of what it takes to do well in school. It is important to note that while the two are often confused and/or conflated, structure and control are not the same thing, and structure can be provided in either an autonomy supportive or controlling way (Jang et al., 2010).
    </p>
    <h2>Engagement</h2>
    <p>
      Engagement has to do with students' involvement — both emotional and behavioral — in learning situations. Engagement can be measured through a person's effort and positive emotion, as well as through the attempts they make to influence a learning environment. (Reeve, Jang, Carrell, Jeon, & Barch, 2004). It acts as a path through which motivation acts on learning and development. Additionally, engagement is used by teachers as a measure of motivation, and has been shown to predict dropout (Reeve et al., 2004). Engagement is influenced by the sociocultural contexts in which learning occurs, including teachers' instructional style. (Jang et al., 2010).
    </p>
    <h2>Theories of Motivation: Intrinsic vs Extrinsic</h2>
    <p>
      Motivation is often described on a continuum from entirely intrinsic to entirely extrinsic. One such scale describes motivation as ranging from autonomous ("I'm studying because it's personally important to me") to controlled ("I'm studying because I would feel guilty if I wouldn't do so) (Vansteenkiste et al., 2012). Other scales of motivation, such as that on the Rochester Assessment Package for Schools — Student Self Report, define four types of motivation: intrinsic self-motivation ("I do my homework because I find it interesting or fun."), identified self-regulation ("I do my homework because I want to understand and learn new things"), introjected self-regulation ("I do my homework because I would feel guilty or ashamed if I did not"), and external self-regulation ("I do my homework because the teacher would get mad or I would get in trouble if I did not") (Tucker et al., 2002).
	Intrinsic motivation can be bolstered by a number of aspects of a learning situation. Connecting learning tasks to objects and characters that are of prior interest to individuals is one such way to bolster intrinsic motivation. Additionally, when individuals are given choices in a task or activity, they are more intrinsically motivated to complete the task. The benefits of choice (higher enjoyment, better performance, and better persistence) appear even when the choices are not of central importance to the task (Cordova & Lepper, 1996).
    </p>
    <h2>Connell's Model of Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Connell outlined a model of motivation in which engagement is the main factor in academic achievement. In this model, teacher instructional styles (structure, autonomy support, interest in the student) affect student self-systems, such as motivation and perceived competence, which in turn affect engagement. Finally, engagement acts directly on academic achievement (as cited in Tucker et al., 2002).
    </p>
    <h2>Mastery vs Performance Climates</h2>
    <p>
      In a mastery climate, students perceive that personal growth in learning and skills is valued. In a performance climate, students perceive that superior performance is rewarded. Mastery climates give students the chance to feel competent and autonomous, whereas performance climates do not provide such opportunities, and thus cause students to feel less self-determined (Cox & Williams, 2008).
    </p>
    <h2>Cognitive Evolution Theory</h2>
    <p>
      Cognitive Evolution Theory is similar to Self Determination Theory in that it posits that people develop motivational styles based on perceptions of their own competence. As in Self Determination Theory, contexts that support autonomy bolster people's perceptions of competence, leading to more intrinsic motivation, whereas controlling contexts thwart perceptions of competence, leading to more extrinsic motivation (Guay, Boggiano, & Vallerand, 2001).
    </p>
    <h2>Diathesis-Stress Model of Motivaiton</h2>
    <p>
      The diathesis-stress model of achievement processes posits motivational style as a more stable trait. Two models emerge.  In the first model, motivational style mediates the relationship between teacher autonomy support and perceived competence — teacher autonomy support affects motivation, which affects perceptions of competence. In the second model, motivational style moderates the relationship between autonomy support and competence — controlling styles are related with lower levels of perceived competence, but only among students with extrinsic motivational styles (Guay et al., 2001).

        Authors: Wendy Grolnick and Richard Ryan <br>
        Published: June 1987 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology <br>
        Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of three learning conditions on rote recall of text, conceptual understanding of text, and feelings of pressure, interest, and effort while reading the text. The three conditions were: Noncontrolling Directed, in which students were asked to read a text and informed they would be asked questions on the passage, but would not be graded; Controlling Directed, in which students were told they would be asked questions on the passage and would be graded; and Undirected, in which students were told they would be asked questions related only to their feelings of interest, pressure, and effort. The study also sought to examine the effects of a intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation on the above outcomes. <br>
        Methods: The study used one-way ANOVAs and Planned Comparison to test for condition effects on dependent variables, as well as hierarchical regression to test for the effects of individual differences in motivational styles as well as condition on the dependent variables. <br>
        Conclusion: The study found that, as expected, Noncontrolling and Controlling Directed conditions were associated with greater rote recall of the text than undirected learning, though the Controlling Directed condition was associated with greater loss in rote recall after one week. Noncontrolling Directed and Nondirected conditions were associated with greater conceptual understanding, as well as greater feelings of interest, and less pressure. Additionally, greater intrinsic motivation was correlated with greater interest across conditions. <br>
        Strengths and Weaknesses: This study used randomized assignment of conditions, giving it experimental strength. However, since the study used only a limited sample of fifth graders, and relied on only one measure of conceptual understanding, the results should not be generalized to the larger population of students. <br>

        Authors: Diana Cordova, Mark Lepper <br>
        Published: 1996 in the Journal of Educational Psychology <br>
        Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of personalization, choice, and contextualization in a learning activity on motivation and academic achievement. <br>
        Methods: The researchers designed five conditions for a math learning game. In the control condition the game was highly generic, unpersonalized, and provided no choice. In the experimental conditions, the game was contextualized in either a space or treasure hunt fantasy context. In two conditions, several generic references were personalized to individuals using a preliminary questionnaire. In one personalized and one unpersonalized condition, individuals were given several nonessential choices, such as the icons in the game and the names of characters. This study used one way ANOVAs to test for the effects of fantasy contexts on dependant variables, as well as personalizationXchoice ANOVAs to look for effects of personalization vs no personalization and choice vs no choice. An ANCOVA was performed with pretest scores as the covariates to look for effects on learning. Finally the study looked for interaction effects between personalization and choice, but found none. <br>
        Conclusions: The study found that students in the fantasy conditions scored significantly higher than the control group on enjoyment, use of strategic moves, use of complex operations like negative numbers, division, and parentheses, difficulty level selected, perceived competence, desire for a more difficult game, and learning outcomes one week later. Personalization similarly showed significant effects in all dependant variables, except difficulty level selected, when compared to no personalization, and choice showed significant effects in all measures except for use of complex operations and difficulty level selected. <br>
        Strengths and Weaknesses: The study's high level of control in all conditions is both a strength and a weakness. While the controls of time spent on task, types of problems presented, and general function of the game lend it more internal validity, it limits the extent to which one can generalize the results. <br>

        Authors: Frédéric Guay, Anne Boggiano, Robert Vallerand <br>
        Published: 2001 in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin <br>
        Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test all three models presented by Cognitive Evolution Theory and the Diathesis-Stress Model in a longitudinal design. The goal is to contribute to existing research, which has yet to test all three models on the same data set, and which has been mostly cross-sectional. <br>
        Methods: The study used the Baron and Kenny conditions for mediation: the independent variables are related to the dependent variables and the mediator, the mediator has an effect on the dependent variable after controlling for independent variable effects, and the inclusion of the mediator reduces the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. This process was modified in order to test for changes in intrinsic motivation and perceived competence as mediators and outcome variables. Additional regression analyses were performed to test for relations between time 1 variables and change, as well as time 2 variables and change. In order to test the moderation model, time 1 and time 2 measures of intrinsic motivation were computed together to create a global motivation score. This was used to compute interaction effects of teacher autonomy support and global motivation. A final regression analysis explored the interaction of teacher autonomy support and perceived competence, to test whether perceived competence acted as a moderator. <br>
        Conclusions: Some support was found for CET's mediation model, in which changes in perceived competence mediates the relationship between teacher autonomy support and changes in intrinsic motivation. Further regression analysis found that intrinsic motivation at time 1 predicted perceived competence at time 2, but perceived competence at time 1 did not predict motivation at time 2. Additionally, perceived competence at time 2 predicted changes in intrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation at time 2 predicted changes in perceived competence. When testing the Diathesis-Stress mediation model, the inclusion of changes in intrinsic motivation reduced the relationship between teacher autonomy support and changes in perceived competence to nonsignificance, supporting full mediation by changes in motivation. Under the moderation model, teacher autonomy support was significantly related to perceived competence only among children with low levels of intrinsic motivation. Finally, perceived competence was not found to moderate the relationship between teacher autonomy support and intrinsic motivation, as is consistent with past research. <br>
        Strengths and Weaknesses: This is one of few longitudinal studies in the area of autonomy support and allows researchers to look at change over time. Despite this, one should not draw strong causal relationships, as the study lasted only one year. Additionally, the outcome variables being measured are influenced by additional contexts such as peers and parents, which this study did not look into. <br>

        Published: 2002 in Psychology in Schools <br>
        Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test the usefulness of Connell's process model of motivation for understanding the influence of teacher context and self-system variables on academic achievement in low income African American students. <br>
        Methods: The study relied on hierarchical regression models to test whether self-system variables mediated the relationship between teacher context and engagement. The first model entered grade level at step one to control for its effects on engagement, the composite score of teacher context at step two, and the composite score of student self-systems at step three. The second model again entered grade level at step one. Teacher autonomy support, structure, and involvement were entered at step two, and perceived competence, perceived autonomy, and perceived relatedness were entered at step three. Finally, separate regression analyses were performed for the lower (1st - 6th) and upper (7th - 12th) grades. <br>
        Conclusions: The first model of the study found that composite student self-system partially mediated the relationship between teacher context and engagement, reducing the strength but not eliminating the significance. The second model found that the relationship between teacher autonomy support, as well as structure, and engagement was completely mediated by self-system variables. Teacher involvement, however, displayed a significant positive relationship with engagement beyond the indirect relationship through student self-systems. When the models were divided by grade ranges, perceived autonomy emerged as a significant predictor for engagement among the younger students, and perceived relatedness emerged as a significant predictor for the upper students. Finally, teacher structure significantly predicted perceived competence, and teacher autonomy support significantly predicted perceived autonomy. <br>
        Strengths and Weaknesses: The study’s major strength is that it looks into the effects of teacher context and student self-system variables on engagement for specifically low-income African American students. It’s main limitation is that the study is cross-sectional instead of longitudinal, meaning we cannot draw conclusions about the direction of the relationship between teacher context and student self-systems and engagement. <br>

        Authors: Valery Chirkov, Richard Ryan <br>
        Published: 2002 in the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology <br>
        Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the validity of Self Determination Theory's claim that autonomy is a universal need. The study compares the perceived parental and teacher autonomy support of U.S. and Russian adolescents, as well as their reported motivational styles, and well-being, measured by feelings of self-esteem, depression, self actualization, and life satisfaction. <br>
        Methods: The study used MACS analysis to test for construct comparability of autonomy-support, well-being, and academic self-regulation. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the hypothesis that parental and teacher autonomy support would predict well being in both groups, as well as the hypothesis that parental and teacher autonomy support would predict academic motivation. <br>
        Conclusions: The measurements were all found to have construct comparability, meaning that cultural differences between the two groups did not affect the underlying characteristics of the measures. Russian students showed evidence of lower self-actualization, self-esteem, life-satisfaction, and perceived autonomy-support from both teachers and parents. There were no significant differences in external regulation  between U.S. and Russian participants. Russian students scored lower on introjected and identified, but were higher in measures of intrinsic motivation. Parental autonomy support, but not teacher autonomy support was found to predict well being in both the Russian and U.S. groups. Parental autonomy support had a negative effect on external regulation and a positive effect on identified regulation, while teacher autonomy support had a positive effect on identified regulation and intrinsic motivation, and a negative effect on external regulation. Overall, teacher autonomy support was a more significant predictor of academic regulation than parental autonomy support for both groups. <br>
        Strengths and Weaknesses: This is one of few studies that investigate the cross-cultural validity of Self Determination Theory. However, the results are not highly generalizable, as they compare only one U.S. school to only one Russian school. Additionally, because the study is cross-sectional and not longitudinal, no definite conclusions can be drawn about the direction of relationships. <br>

        Published: 2004 in Motivation and Emotion <br>
        Purpose: This study sought to answer the question of whether teachers can be taught to be more autonomy supportive, and whether an increase in autonomy support leads to an increase in student engagement (and not the other way around, as could be the case in studies that are not longitudinal). <br>
        Methods: The experimental group of teachers received instruction on autonomy support between time 1 and time 2, while the control/delayed treatment group received instruction on autonomy support between time 2 and time 3. The study used an ANCOVA with autonomy behaviors at time 1 as the covariate to test the effect of instruction on teachers' autonomy support. The study also used a within subject repeated measures design to test whether the increase in engagement at time 2 and time 3 was due to an increase in autonomy support. Hierarchical regression was used to predict engagement: autonomy support and engagement at time 1 was entered as the first step, autonomy support at time 2 was entered as the second step — thus they were able to control for initial autonomy support and engagement. To test for inflation of scores due to raters scoring both dependent and independent variables, rater 1's rating of teachers' autonomy support was used to predict rater 2's rating of students' engagement and vice versa. <br>
        Conclusions: The study found that teachers showed significantly more autonomy supportive behaviours after receiving instruction on autonomy support. Additionally, increases in engagement between time 1 and time 2 were found only in the experimental group, supporting the hypothesis that increased autonomy support would lead to increased engagement. For the delayed treatment group, increase in autonomy supportive behaviors and student engagement were found at time 3, while no such increase was found between time 2 and time 3 for the experimental group, which received no additional instruction between time 2 and 3. <br>
        Strengths and Weaknesses: This study's main strength lies in the ability to show the direction of the relationship between increased autonomy support and increased student engagement. It's main weakness lies in the small sample size, which limits its external validity and generalizability. <br>

        Authors: Anne Cox, Lavon Williams <br>
        Published: 2008 Journal of Sports and Exercise Psychology <br>
        Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore whether or not needs satisfaction (in terms of feelings of competence, autonomy, and relatedness) mediates the relationship between social context (in terms of teacher support and mastery vs performance context) and self-determined motivation. <br>
        Methods: Structural equation modeling was used to test for mediation. First, a full mediation model in which social context has only indirect effects through need satisfaction on self-determined motivation was tested. Then an alternate model was tested in which social context has indirect and direct effects on self-determined motivation. Because teacher support was found to suppress the relationship between mastery climate and need satisfaction, the two measures of social context were split, resulting in four models — teacher support having only indirect vs direct and indirect effects on motivation, and mastery context having only indirect vs direct and indirect effects on motivation. <br>
        Conclusions: For mastery climate, the model in which mastery climate has both direct and indirect (through need satisfaction) effects on motivation fit the data better than the model in which the effects were only indirect. In fact, in this model, only the direct relationship was significant, meaning need satisfaction did not mediate the relationship between mastery context and motivation. For teacher support, the model of both indirect and direct effects fit the data better than only indirect effects. Both the direct and indirect relationships were significant, meaning that need satisfaction partially mediated the relationship between teacher support and motivation. Additionally, both teacher support and mastery climate significantly and positively predicted need satisfaction, especially relatedness. These findings contradict much of the existing research in physical education which have found need satisfaction to fully mediate the relationship between social context and motivation. <br>
        Strengths and Weaknesses: This study had strong statistical methods, and explicitly tested for validity and assumptions of statistical tests. Its limitations lie in some of its measures. For example, the weak relationship between perceived autonomy and motivation, which contradicts self determination theory, may have been due to how the study measure perceived autonomy (emphasizing choice of activities). Additionally, performance climate was dropped from analysis because it lacked internal consistency. Finally, because the study is cross-sectional and not longitudinal, no definite conclusions can be drawn about the direction of relationships. <br>

        Published: 2009 in Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport <br>
        Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of teacher autonomy support and students' motivation on students' needs satisfaction, learning achievement, and cardiorespiratory fitness. <br>
        Methods: Three hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between teacher autonomy support and need satisfaction (perceived competence, autonomous motivation, and perceived relatedness). For each regression analysis, scores at time 1 for the measure of need satisfaction were entered at step one, scores at time 2 were entered at step 2, and teacher autonomy support was entered at T3. A second hierarchical regression analysis entered teacher autonomy support and autonomous motivation at T1 as the first step, the interaction between teacher autonomy support and autonomous motivation at T1 as the second step, and learning outcomes as the third step. Regression analyses were performed for the relationship between teacher autonomy support and learning achievement for students grouped as high vs low on autonomous motivation. Finally, a hierarchical regression analysis was performed with teacher autonomy support and autonomous motivation at time 1 entered in step 1, the interaction between the two at step 2, and cardiorespiratory fitness in step three. <br>
        Conclusions: Teacher Autonomy support significantly predicted all three measures of need satisfaction. Teacher autonomy support but not autonomous motivation predicted learning achievement. Teacher autonomy support was significantly related to learning achievement for students initially low in autonomous motivation but not for students initially high in autonomous motivation. Neither autonomous motivation nor teacher autonomy support, nor the interaction between the two significantly predicted cardiorespiratory fitness. However, change in autonomous motivation was found to predict cardiorespiratory fitness. <br>
        Strengths and Weaknesses: One strength of this study was its longitudinal nature, offering more information about the direction of the relationships. It is limited though because it was not experimental, and therefore some causality of changes may still be vague in terms of direction. <br>

        Purpose: This study investigated whether teacher-provided autonomy support and teacher-provided-structure were related to one another in naturally occurring instruction, and whether autonomy support as well as structure make unique contributions in supporting students' engagement in the classroom. <br>
        Methods: The study used hierarchical linear modeling to find unique contributions to variance in engagement at the classroom level, i.e. attributable not to differences between schools. <br>
        Conclusions: Increased autonomy support and structure were correlated with higher collective student engagement, but only increased autonomy support was correlated with increased individual student engagement. Teacher provision of structure was linearly related to their provision of autonomy support — as structure increased, so did autonomy support. <br>
        Strengths and Weaknesses: The use of hierarchical linear modeling allowed the researchers to examine unique effects of teacher instructional style, separate from between school effects, on student engagement. However, the study does not fully address contributions by autonomy support as unique from contributions from structure to student engagement. The study also does not differentiate what aspects of engagement are being affected. Finally, because grade level has an effect on how much self-regulation is expected from students, and because high school students have been shown to have lower engagement overall than younger students, these results cannot be directly generalized outside of high school students. Additionally, because the study is not longitudinal, it can not be said with 100% certainty that the directional relationship is Teacher instructional style —> Student engagement, as it is possible and likely that at least some of the instructional style is influenced by the level of student engagement. <br>

        Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore whether autonomy support constitute two separate, though correlated, realms of teacher instructional style, or whether they are dichotomously related along one continuum. The second aim of this study was to explore the effects of structure and autonomy support on a variety of outcomes, such as motivation, test anxiety, time management, information processing, persistence, and school related problem behavior, such as skipping class. <br>
        Methods: The study used confirmatory factor analysis as well as cluster analysis to explore the relationship between autonomy support and structure. Additionally, a MANOVA and a MANCOVA with gender and grade entered as covariates were used to find the effects of the clusters on the outcome measures. <br>
        Conclusions: The cluster analysis yielded four clusters: high autonomy support-clear expectations, clear expectations, autonomy support, and low autonomy support-vague expectations. High autonomy support-clear expectations was associated with significantly higher levels of autonomous motivation, time management, concentration, perseverance, and information processing. It was also associated with significantly lower levels of problem behaviors. Low autonomy support-vague expectations was associated with significantly lower levels of autonomous motivation, time management, concentration, perseverance, and information processing. It was also associated with significantly higher levels of problem behavior. The two varying conditions were associated with moderate levels of all of the above outcomes, and showed no significant variance between them. Only high autonomy support-clear expectations showed significantly lower levels of test anxiety, with no significant variance between the other three clusters. Finally, the only significant differences in controlled motivation were between clear expectations and low autonomy support-vague expectations, with clear expectations yielding more controlled motivation. <br>
        Strengths and Weaknesses: One strength of this study is that it examines the covariance of structure and autonomy support. Its limitations lie in the fact that it asked students to assess all their teachers as a whole instead of individual teachers or subjects, and the fact that it used a limited measure of structure, focusing only on clear expectations. Additionally, because the study is cross-sectional and not longitudinal, conclusions about the direction of relationships between instructional style and academic outcomes, behavioral problems, and motivation cannot be made. <br>
